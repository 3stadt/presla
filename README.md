# Presla

Presla (Presentation Lambda) is an application that runs on your computer. It creates a local webserver that is equipped with [remarkjs](https://remarkjs.com/), allowing you to create your own presentations in markdown.

Additionaly, it is configured so it can execute Code examples directly from within your presentation, using [ace editor](https://ace.c9.io/) and code executors written in JS. Everything can be completely customized.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need a x64 based Mac, Linux or Windows System and a Web Browser. Preferably Google Chrome.

### Installing

Download the file matching your operating system [here](https://github.com/3stadt/presla/releases). In detail, you can choose as following:

* presla-x.x.x-linux-amd64 for Linux
* presla-x.x.x-darwin-amd64 for Mac
* presla-x.x.x-windows-amd64.exe for Windows

Save it in any directory. Give it executables permissions, `chmod +x <file>` on Linux/Mac.

Execute the file via console. Although double clicking is fine, this will close all log output when finished.

Access Presla via [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

At this point you'll only see the included info presentation, since you yet need to create your presentations.
